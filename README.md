# LeaguePool

LeaguePool is a web app I created to help League players add champions to their pool in order to have a champion that has a favorable matchup against any commonly played champion in a given role.

**Note: LeaguePool is still in progress and while it is technically in working condition, it is still in its very early stages.**

## Usage

Navigate to http://3.145.60.140:5000/ to use the web app.
#### Currently, there is functionality for:
- Choosing a rank and role to generate the champ pool (Only Top and Gold for now)
- Adding current champions to be included in the champ pool calculations
- Excluding specific champions from the champ pool calculations

#### Future plans:
- Add image icons for all champions
- Improve aesthetics for the webpage
- Ability to show details of favorable matchups for different champions
- View that allows you to manually create a champ pool, showing you which champions your pool has a favorable matchup against as you go
- View that lets you compare win rates against a champion for your champ pool
